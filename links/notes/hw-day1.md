Hi,
Some notes ahead of the class. First, it is hands on - lot of lab time.

If there are questions before the class starts, or after the training, the best place for QA:
<http://gitter.im/murder-best/Lobby>
Also during lecture, if the question does not get answered right away because the topic is for a later lab, ask there.  Test it out please.

Here is the check list setup and prep HW so that we can spend more time in lecture:
(Est time 90 minutes). Don't worry if you don't grok it all yet, you will.

1. Download VS Code Editor and install
<https://code.visualstudio.com/Download>

2. 
a)Create account on 
<http://site44.com>

b) On Site44, create a 'NAME' web site / web app. NAME is what your project will show up on www.
This will create a Dropbox/Apps/site44/NAME.site44.com/index.html.

c) Using VS Code, edit this index.html to say something else than default.

d) In Chrome browser, go to https://NAME.site44.com. Make sure developer tools are 'enabled/open'
You should see the changed index page, w/ your new content.

Congrats, you are now a web master.
